   - images/jasminetea.png
   - images/lemontea.png

   - images/blacktea.png
   - images/chocolatetea.png
   - images/ppl1.jpg
   - images/ppl2.jpg
   - images/ppl3.jpg
   - images/welcome.jpg
   - images/about.jpg
   - images/icon.png
   - images/workingplace.jpg
   - images/food1.jpg
   - images/food2.jpg

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.io/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.io/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts: 
  - family: Stocky
    fonts:
        - asset: fonts/stocky.ttf
  #
  # For details regarding fonts from package dependencies,
  # see https://flutter.io/custom-fonts/#from-packages
